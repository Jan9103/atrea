# ATREA

A unofficial 3rd party alternate [twitch](https://twitch.tv) recommendation algorythm for nerds.

Why for nerds? because its "hard" to run and works best with some sort of homelab.  
It is also not viable to host it for the masses thanks to [rate limits](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/chat/#rate-limits).
